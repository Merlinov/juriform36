# juriform36

The juriform36 keyboard is a ergonomic split, wireless keyboard with 36 keys, powered by [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/).

<img src="/images/overview.jpg">

It's "dactyl manuform like", but just tened and with tilted rows. There no curvature between columns and also no height difference between the columns.

The design is adjusted and tuned to my (Juris) hands, thus the name. I designed the case from scratch using [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.de/products/fusion-360/).

I tried to keep it as simple as possible and went diodeless and wired every button to an individual pin of the [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano).

As a little bonus I added [nice!view](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-view) displays.
